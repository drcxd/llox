This is an implementation of the =jlox= interpreter in [[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting
Interpreters]] in Lua.

* Why Lua

=jlox= is implemented in Java. However, my development environment is
not friendly to Java development, and I do not like the language too
much. I would like to implement in C++, however, C++ lacks some key
features Java provided, such as a garbage collector. Thus, I decide to
use Lua as the implementing language, since I am familiar with it, and
I already have a comfortable development environment for it, and it is
similar to Java -- it has a garbage collector.
